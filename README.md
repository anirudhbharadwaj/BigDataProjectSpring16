The purpose of this project is to elaborate upon the understanding of the rankings of popular places in New York City, the competition between these places in attracting people, the economic position of people coming to these places and few other interesting facts based on analysing past 6 years of Yellow Taxi data. We were more interested in analysing the trends in the number of people visiting a particular place rather than sudden spike/drop in the counts. The project is also used to check the fairness in articles that report a downward trend. For example, if an article states that pizza sales have gone down over the years but taxi data shows the trends to be not decreasing, the article is disproved. However, if the trends of taxi data agree with the article, it doesnâ€™t prove the article to be right but supports the statement. Ideas for trends during holidays, weekdays, weekends etc., will also be taken into account. The average tip for a particular location will be used to reflect on the economic class of the people arriving there and their mood.
The yellow taxi data is crunched using pyspark code and visualization is done using tableau.
